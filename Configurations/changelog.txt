[Version 1.1]

[Fixed] How commands parse user arguments. Instead of manually parsing a @mention the discord.py
Convert is used. It can now handle @mention, discord_IDs, usernames and display names. 

[Added] Since username look ups are case sensitive I added a function that pulls all the user
names from the DB and than manually search through it for match the string then return the
the discord ID saved in the DB
