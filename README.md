PantherLily is a custom bot made to server a single Clash of Clans discord server, 
[Zulu](https://discord.gg/nGcdnsm5eH), a clan that is part of the /r/ClashofClans family of Clans.

The bot servers as a way to ease management of players from making sure they are active, to tracking 
the players current location in game. The bot maintains a history of admin messages when a user is removed
that way the admin does not need to remember why a user was removed from the clan.


The bot runs on 3 containers, one for the database, one for the discord bot and a background daemon to keep updating
the database.
